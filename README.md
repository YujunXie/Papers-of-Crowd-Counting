## 1. Introduce

**`Box-X`** is a Tool-box for Efficient Build and Debug in Python.   

Especially for **Scientific Computing** and **Computer Vision**. 

So, all Tools are divided into 2 parts by wether the tool is general used:    
 * **General Python Tool**: Tools could be used anywhere in Python

 * **Scientific Computing and Computer Vision Tool**: Those tools are useful in Scientific Computing and Computer Vision field
 

P.S. **`boxx`** supports both **`Python 2/3`** on **`Linux | macOS | Windows`** with **`CPython | IPython | Spyder | Notebook`** environment.
